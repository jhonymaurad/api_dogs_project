## React Project Two  --Find a Friend--

## Project Description

I want to use the The Dog API to create a website to help make the right choice about what type of dog is right for you.

in the website you can search by breed from a dropdown menu. The information and a picture will be display for that specific choice of breed.

I also want to implement a post your own dog info to the website.

## MVP
Users can choose from  a list of breeds and a detail information for that specific breed will show,
including a picture for that breed.

Users can post pictures from their dogs along with some information to the website.
