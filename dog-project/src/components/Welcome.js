    <p>Choosing a dog can be exciting and nerve-wracking at the same
      time. After all, you're committing to care for a living, breathing
      being who will depend on you his entire life! When choosing a
      new dog, so many questions run through your mind: "What kind of
       dog should I get?" "What's the best dog breed for me?" "Will
       he be a good fit with my family?"</p>
    <p> The first step to being a responsible dog owner begins before
       you even bring home a dog. Thoughtfully and seriously assess
       your needs before making a decision, and you'll live long,
       happy lives together. Using our Dog Breed Selector, just
       answer a series of questions, and we'll find the right breed
       of dog for you.
